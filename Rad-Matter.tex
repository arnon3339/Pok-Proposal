\section{Proton Interaction with Matter}

When proton radiate to matter, it can interact with electrons, neutron and whole atoms.(Bichsel, 1968) The energy of proton can lose to those interactions and the atoms interaction have very low of the lose of proton energies. Within electron interaction, they lose only a small fraction of their energy in a single interaction (at most 4 m 1M 0.0022, where m is the
electron mass and M is the proton mass).
